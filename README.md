# US Mobility

## Introduction

It is critical to analyze and study the different aspects of population movement (mobility, trips and population at home)
as it can provide meaningful insights to 

1.	Understand spending and economical behavior to optimize business decisions such as marketing, staffing, advertising etc.
2.	Curb disease spread. Mobility information has been heavily studied to track COVID-19 spread [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2)
3.	Better transport facilities and fleet / traffic management 
4.	Better understanding on  population/location based characteristics on movement dynamics


## Data Source and Basic Transformations
The trips data is released by [BTS](https://data.bts.gov/Research-and-Statistics/Trips-by-Distance/w96p-f2qv) 


## Country Level Time Series

Notes:
1. 7 day periodicity observed in all data due to weekday/weekend differences

2. Lower mobility in winter months compared to summer months

3. Sharp drop observed at March 2020 due to nationwide restrictions and shutdown related to COVID

4. Increase in mobility/trips seen in Jun 2020 due to easing/lifting COVID based restrictions
